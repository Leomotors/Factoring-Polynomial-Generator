## Program Example

Note: This is in Generator Mode, there is much more in interactive Mode where it is like you're playing a game!

```
1) Solve 2x² - x - 66 = 0
2) Solve 6x² + 65x + 150 = 0
3) Solve 2x² + 43x + 195 = 0
4) Solve 9x² + 39x - 14 = 0
5) Solve x² - 4x - 221 = 0
6) Solve 2x² - 47x + 171 = 0
7) Solve 9x² + 18x - 160 = 0
8) Solve x² - 6x - 160 = 0
9) Solve x² + 11x + 30 = 0
10) Solve 6x² - 11x + 4 = 0
```
